<span style="color:red">After each task you will be required to save your plots as an image or screenshot using the filenames specified.  You will be uploading these images during your final project submission so they can be evaluated by your peers. </span>

 Objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to:

- Create informative and visually appealing plots with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Apply visualization to communicate insights from the data.
- Analyze data through using visualizations.
- Customize visualizations

For this lab, we will be using the following libraries:

*   [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for managing the data.
*   [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for mathematical operations.
*   [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for plotting.

# **Part 2: Create Dashboard using Plotly and Dash**

Scenario:
The objective of this part of the Final Assignment is to analyze the historical trends in automobile sales during recession periods, as you did in the previous part. The goal is to provide insights into how the sales of XYZAutomotives, a company specializing in automotive sales, were affected during times of recession.

In this final assignment, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate the Dashboarding skills you have acquired in this course.

This lab aims to assess your abilities in creating various visualizations using Plotly and Dash. As a data scientist, you have been given a task to prepare a report on your finding from Automobile Sales data analysis.
You decided to develop a dashboard representing two main reports:

- Yearly Automobile Sales Statistics
- Recession Period Statistics
NOTE: Year range is between 1980 and 2013.

Components of the report items
1. Yearly Automobile Sales Statistics

This report mainly consists of the following items:

- Yearly Automobile Sales Using Line Chart for the Whole Period (line chart):This line chart displays the average automobile sales for each year across the entire period.

- Total Monthly Automobile Sales Using Line Chart (line chart):This line chart displays the total monthly automobile sales for the selected year.

- Average Vehicles Sold by Vehicle Type in the Selected Year (bar chart):This bar chart shows the average number of vehicles sold for each vehicle type in the selected year.

- Total Advertisement Expenditure for Each Vehicle Using Pie Chart (pie chart): This pie chart represents the total advertising expenditure for each vehicle type in the selected year.

2. Recession Period Statistics

- Average Automobile Sales Fluctuation Over Recession Period (Year-wise):This line chart shows the average automobile sales for each year during recession periods.

- Average Number of Vehicles Sold by Vehicle Type:This bar chart displays the average number of vehicles sold for each vehicle type during recession periods.

- Total Expenditure Share by Vehicle Type During Recessions:This pie chart represents the total advertising expenditure share by vehicle type during recession periods.

- Effect of Unemployment Rate on Vehicle Type and Sales:This bar chart shows the effect of unemployment rate on automobile sales by vehicle type during recession periods.
